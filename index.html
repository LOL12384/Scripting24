        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>My name is Alexandra Hillyer. I am currently enrolled at Lethbridge polytechnic. I am taking the multimedia productions Program. I enjoy gaming, watching movies, Reading Books, Reading Comics, crocheting, Mini golfing, 3D printing, I like traveling, Star gazing. I am hoping to into video game making or doing editing for movies. For Video games I hope I can join Xbox or Nintendo. Then for editing movies I would like to join Disney and if not one of the following Pixar, Warner Bros, Marvel Studios and Studio Ghibli. Why I want to join Disney is because I have Really enjoyed a lot of their Movies and a part of me has always want to work for them. One reason I want to Join Studio Ghibli is because I grew up watching their movies. If I go into games, I would really like to work for Nintendo because from a young age I have been playing on their consoles and playing Pok√©mon and that enjoyment of playing those games has made me want to make good games like the ones I have played so then I can inspire others to have fun.</p>
